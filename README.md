# webpack-one-o-one

- `npm install`
- `npm run serve`
- Go to `localhost:8080`
- Make changes in your js files, and they should be reflected in the webpage without a reload
- Sources in Dev Tools should be showing the actual sources

## Further Notes
Also try:
- `npm run build-dev`
- `npm run build-prod`
- `npm run watch`

## Reminder
`webpack-dev-server` does not build your files. There will not be a `dist` folder when you run `webpack serve`..
